This is a light Cinder Block exposing Chrome's V8 script parsing technology to Cinder.

There are two samples that show a bit of the backbone of V8. The first is a simple HelloWorld showing the creation of a context and parsing a "Hello, World!" string. The second sample opens a Javascript shell and processes the information. 

Take a look at https://developers.google.com/v8/intro for more info.
